Welcome to the **PIT -** Polymer Incentivized Testnet! 

The PIT embodies Polymer‚Äôs commitment to innovation, security, and scalability to the interoperability landscape. Polymer brings together developers, rollup and infrastructure operators to explore, build, and contribute towards the _Interchain_ thesis.

As an initiative to honor developers instrumental to Ethereum's scalability via Layer-2 infra, cross-chain application development, and advancing IBC in the Cosmos ecosystem, we're offering rewards for their past contributions.

### Polymer HUB
Polymer Hub is the first Layer 2 natively built for interoperability, connecting Ethereum‚Äôs growing rollup ecosystem using Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol. Polymer‚Äôs initial focus is to provide the developer community with tools to connect the Superchain and permissionlessly add new OP-stack rollups to the wider Superchain network. The Polymer Hub brings IBC as the centerpiece of the superchain and helps rollups communicate with a common messaging standard. In order to better understand and test out IBC‚Äôs capabilities, welcome PIT Phase-1. 

# Phase 1 Guidelines

The PIT presents you with Phase 1 and the initial set of 3 quests. Each quest will provide guidance for some exciting use-cases for the Polymer community. However, these quests truly are meant for guidance and are optional, Polymer welcomes innovation! 

If you have an exciting use-case, propose it in our forum, team up with fellow devs and propose it over [here](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/issues/16). 

## Quests Overview 
All our quests or use-cases are presented as [issues](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/issues) under specific labels for better categorization. 

### 1. Create a cross-chain dApp using using IBC (with custom or universal channels).
**Label: [dApp development](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:relevance-desc+label:%22dApp+development%22)**

We will be exploring application development with IBC as a messaging standard.

One of the great things of IBC is its ability to allow developers to build their own bridge by having their independent communication channels that no other application can use. This enables vastly reduced risk between the various instances of an application on different chains.

Some quests help you understand IBC features and how they improve the UX for known use-cases (like token bridging) and help you imagine the realm of possibilities for future developments. 

Given this category is broad, we will be diving it further with additional labels as and when required like token bridging label.

### 2. Contribute to implementing the IBC standards in Solidity or create your own standard.
**Label: [IBC Solidity](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22IBC+Solidity%22)**

IBC is a well documented and battle-tested protocol with many developers contributing code/standards to improve its developer experience and help other applications build off of their work. The PIT empowers further contributions, there are a few IBC standards Polymer thinks can be used by a wide variety of applications.



### 3. Contribute to building Polymer developer tooling ecosystem.
**Label: [developer tooling](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22developer+tooling%22)**

Help build a world class Developer experience, for developer by developers.

As Cosmoethereum is in its early stages, there's a wealth of opportunities to contribute to its developer tooling. Whether it's creating a ready-to-deploy SDK for vIBC smart contracts facilitating new rollups connecting to Polymer, or improving the IBC explorer, your contributions can make a significant difference!

We will be expanding the quest categories as we reveal more partners taking part in our testnet. 

## Participation Instructions 

### Start your project 
- **Decide a use-case:** Whether you're looking to built a use-case already mentioned in our [quests](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/issues) or planning to innovate (propose use-case [here](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/issues/16)). 
- **Teams:** In case you are looking for team members to collaborate with, comments your team requirements under in [Team registry](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/issues/17) as per the provided template to connect with potential teammates or to list yourself.
- **Development Resources:** You are good to start building! Jumpstart your project with our comprehensive [developer documentation](https://docs.polymerlabs.org/), especially if you plan to interact with testnet contracts. These resources are designed to guide you through the initial setup and development stages. 
- **Community and Support:** For any development-related queries, head over to our [developer forum](https://forum.polymerlabs.org/). The Polymer Labs team and the Polymer developer community are there to assist you, ensuring help is always at hand when you need it.

**Note:** Regular updates and check-ins can enhance your PIT experience. Keep an eye on [announcements](https://twitter.com/Polymer_Labs) and utilize the forums for collaboration and support.

### Submission format 
To ensure a smooth and fair evaluation process, all PIT participants are required to adhere to the following submission criteria:

1. **Project Repository:** Submit your project as a public GitHub repository containing all source code, assets, and necessary documentation.
2. **Comprehensive README:** Your repository must include a detailed **`README.md`** file covering the project overview, installation and usage instructions, technologies used, and team member contributions.
3. **Testnet Interactions (Must):** Provide documented proof of testnet interactions, including transaction hashes, smart contract addresses (or Port).
4. **Demo Video (Recommended):** Enhance your submission with a short demo video (5-10 minutes) showcasing your project's key features and functionality. Videos will help us priortise projects for evaluation. 


Please refer to the detailed [Submission Format](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/blob/main/Participant%20Instructions/Submission%20Format.md) for comprehensive guidelines.

### Judging criteria 
The PIT consists of a predefined [scoring rubric](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/blob/main/Participant%20Instructions/Judging%20Criteria.md#scoring-rubric) to provide transparency and fairness in evaluating contributions across a spectrum of activities, from dApp development to protocol implementation and beyond. This rubric not only sets clear expectations but also guides participants towards contributing high-quality work that advances the Polymer ecosystem.

To maintain engagement and a competitive spirit among teams and developers, we will implement a leaderboard to track team's performance according to the rubric. This will help Polymer ultimately facilitate rewards, promoting healthy competition and community engagement, encouraging participants to put their best foot forward.

**Submissions will be reviewed on a rolling basis and to help us priortize your project - provide a working demo, engage with community and start onboarding users. Team that can showcase adoption within the community will be prioritzed.** 

## Developer Incentives
PIT offers developers opportunities for engagement and potentially influence the future direction of Polymer's interop solutions. By excelling on the leaderboard, which will be rewarded based on percentile, participants can earn reward attributes and stand a chance to receive potential future developer allocation.

Moreover, teams demonstrating substantial and meaningful development have the opportunity to advance to Polymer‚Äôs Launch Partner Program. This program is designed to support the most promising projects in transitioning from concept to market. Selected teams will benefit from:

- Comprehensive support from Polymer to launch their protocol to the market.
- Incentives to attract and bootstrap early adopters.
- Exclusive access to Polymer resources and network.

### Additional Reward Attributes
In recognition of exceptional contributions and achievements, additional rewards will be bestowed upon:

- The top 3 teams on the leaderboard.
- The leading project within each Quest category.
- Contributions that propose meaningful or particularly fun use-cases.
- Participants who stand out for their community contributions.
- Projects that exhibit the "Most Wow Factor".

In future these incentives will not just reward technical excellence but also our wider community in the following Phases of the PIT.

Note: Reward Attributes will be alloted as is (not divided) to all the developers in a registered team, make sure to register!

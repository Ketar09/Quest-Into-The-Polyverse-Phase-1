# Phase 1 Guidelines

The PIT presents you with Phase 1 and the initial set of 3 quests. Each quest will provide guidance for some exciting use-cases for the Polymer community. However, these quests truly are meant for guidance and are optional, Polymer welcomes innovation! If you have an exciting use-case, propose it in our forum, team up with fellow devs and get building.

### Quests Overview 
1. Create a dApp using universal/custom channels
2. Contribute to IBC Solidity standards
3. Help build Polymer developer tooling

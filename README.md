Welcome to the **PIT -** Polymer Incentivized Testnet! 

The PIT embodies Polymer‚Äôs commitment to innovation, security, and scalability to the interoperability landscape. Polymer brings together developers, rollup and infrastructure operators to explore, build, and contribute towards the _Interchain_ thesis.

# Phase 1 Guidelines

The PIT presents you with Phase 1 and the initial set of 3 quests. Each quest will provide guidance for some exciting use-cases for the Polymer community. However, these quests truly are meant for guidance and are optional, Polymer welcomes innovation! If you have an exciting use-case, propose it in our forum, team up with fellow devs and get building.

## Quests Overview 

### 1. Create a cross-chain dApp using using IBC (with custom or universal channels).
One of the great things of IBC is its ability to allow applications to have their own independent communication channels that no other application can use. This enables vastly reduced risk between the various instances of an application on different chains. 

TO DO: Sub division and label reference 

### 2. Contribute to implementing the IBC standards in Solidity or create your own standard.

IBC is a well documented and battle-tested protocol with many developers contributing code/standards to improve its developer experience and help other applications build off of their work. The PIT empowers further contributions, there are a few IBC standards Polymer thinks can be used by a wide variety of applications.

IBC is a complete interop protocol with a well-defined specification, called the the InterChain Standards or ICS for short. There's a clear separation between the state and transport layers on the one hand (this is what Polymer has contributed to for L2-L2 commmunication) and the application layer.

TO DO: Label reference 

### 3. Contribute to building Polymer developer tooling ecosystem.

Help build a world class Developer experience, for developer by developers.

As Cosmoethereum is in its early stages, there's a wealth of opportunities to contribute to its developer tooling. Whether it's creating a ready-to-deploy SDK for vIBC smart contracts facilitating new rollups connecting to Polymer, or improving the IBC explorer, your contributions can make a significant difference!

TO DO: Label reference 

## Participation Instructions 

### Start your project 
- **Team Formation:** Whether you're looking to collaborate or prefer to tackle the challenge solo, find the right fit. Explore the [Team Registry](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/tree/main/Participant%20Instructions/Team%20Registry) to connect with potential teammates or to list your team if you're seeking additional members.
- **Team Registration:** Once your team is formed, make sure to [register teams](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/blob/main/Participant%20Instructions/Teams.md#team-registry) by providing all relevant details about your project. This includes the challenge you've chosen to address or any innovative ideas you plan to explore. Registration ensures you're officially in the running and helps us support you throughout the hackathon.
- **Development Resources:** Jumpstart your project with our comprehensive [developer documentation](https://docs.polymerlabs.org/), especially if you plan to interact with testnet contracts. These resources are designed to guide you through the initial setup and development stages. 
- **Community and Support:** For any development-related queries, head over to our [developer forum](https://forum.polymerlabs.org/). The Polymer Labs team and the Polymer developer community are there to assist you, ensuring help is always at hand when you need it.

**Note:** Regular updates and check-ins can enhance your PIT experience. Keep an eye on [announcements](https://twitter.com/Polymer_Labs) and utilize the forums for collaboration and support.

### Submission format 
To ensure a smooth and fair evaluation process, all PIT participants are required to adhere to the following submission criteria:

1. **Project Repository:** Submit your project as a public GitHub repository containing all source code, assets, and necessary documentation.
2. **Comprehensive README:** Your repository must include a detailed **`README.md`** file covering the project overview, installation and usage instructions, technologies used, and team member contributions.
3. **Testnet Interactions (Must):** Provide documented proof of testnet interactions, including transaction hashes, smart contract addresses (or Port).
4. **Demo Video (Recommended):** Enhance your submission with a short demo video (5-10 minutes) showcasing your project's key features and functionality. Videos will help us priortise projects for evaluation. 


Please refer to the detailed [Submission Format](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/blob/main/Participant%20Instructions/Submission%20Format.md) for comprehensive guidelines.

### Judging criteria 
The PIT consists of a predefined [scoring rubric](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/blob/main/Participant%20Instructions/Judging%20Criteria.md#scoring-rubric) to provide transparency and fairness in evaluating contributions across a spectrum of activities, from dApp development to protocol implementation and beyond. This rubric not only sets clear expectations but also guides participants towards contributing high-quality work that advances the Polymer ecosystem.

To maintain engagement and a competitive spirit among teams and developers, we will implement a leaderboard that tracks the points scored. This will help Polymer facilitate rewards, promoting healthy competition and community engagement, encouraging participants to put their best foot forward.

## Developer Incentives
PIT offers developers opportunities for engagement and potentially influence the future direction of Polymer's interop solutions. Thus, performance on the leaderboard (percentile based) enables participants to accumulate reward attributes and potential developer allocation in the future. 

At the same time teams who are able to showcase meaningful development get the opporunity to graduate to Polymer's Launch Partner Program - wherein they receive Polymer support to take their protocol to market, incentives to bootstrap early users and gain exclusive access to Polymer resources. 

Additional rewards attributes will be given for:
- Top 3 teams in the leaderboard
- Top project in each Quest category
- Proposing meaningful or fun use-cases
- Most community contribution
- Most wow factor

Welcome to the **PIT -** Polymer Incentivized Testnet! 

The PIT embodies Polymer’s commitment to innovation, security, and scalability to the interoperability landscape. The Polymer hub brings together for developers, rollup and eigen infrastructure operators to explore, build, and contribute towards the Superchain thesis.

# Phase 1 Guidelines

The PIT presents you with Phase 1 and the initial set of 3 quests. Each quest will provide guidance for some exciting use-cases for the Polymer community. However, these quests truly are meant for guidance and are optional, Polymer welcomes innovation! If you have an exciting use-case, propose it in our forum, team up with fellow devs and get building.

### Quests Overview 
1. Create a dApp using universal/custom channels
2. Contribute to IBC Solidity standards
3. Help build Polymer developer tooling 

Dive deeper into the quests in the `\quests` directory

NOTE: Solutions that are effective for broader community engagement will be scored highly.

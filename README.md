Welcome to the **PIT -** Polymer Incentivized Testnet! 

The PIT embodies Polymer‚Äôs commitment to innovation, security, and scalability to the interoperability landscape. Polymer brings together developers, rollup and infrastructure operators to explore, build, and contribute towards the _Interchain_ thesis.

# Phase 1 Guidelines

The PIT presents you with Phase 1 and the initial set of 3 quests. Each quest will provide guidance for some exciting use-cases for the Polymer community. However, these quests truly are meant for guidance and are optional, Polymer welcomes innovation! If you have an exciting use-case, propose it in our forum, team up with fellow devs and get building.

### Quests Overview 
1. Create a cross-chain dApp using using IBC (with custom or universal channels).
2. Contribute to implementing the IBC standards in Solidity or create your own standard.
3. Contribute to building Polymer developer tooling ecosystem.

Dive deeper into each of these in the [Quest](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/tree/main/quests) directory.

NOTE: Solutions that are effective for broader community engagement will be scored highly.

## Participation Instructions 

### Start your project 
- **Team Formation:** Whether you're looking to collaborate or prefer to tackle the challenge solo, find the right fit. Explore the [Team Registry](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/tree/main/Participant%20Instructions/Team%20Registry) to connect with potential teammates or to list your team if you're seeking additional members.
- **Team Registration:** Once your team is formed, make sure to [register teams](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/blob/main/Participant%20Instructions/Teams.md#team-registry) by providing all relevant details about your project. This includes the challenge you've chosen to address or any innovative ideas you plan to explore. Registration ensures you're officially in the running and helps us support you throughout the hackathon.
- **Development Resources:** Jumpstart your project with our comprehensive [developer documentation](https://docs.polymerlabs.org/), especially if you plan to interact with testnet contracts. These resources are designed to guide you through the initial setup and development stages. 
- **Community and Support:** For any development-related queries, head over to our [developer forum](https://forum.polymerlabs.org/). The Polymer Labs team and the Polymer developer community are there to assist you, ensuring help is always at hand when you need it.

**Note:** Regular updates and check-ins can enhance your PIT experience. Keep an eye on [announcements](https://twitter.com/Polymer_Labs) and utilize the forums for collaboration and support.

### Submission format 
To ensure a smooth and fair evaluation process, all PIT participants are required to adhere to the following submission criteria:

1. **Project Repository:** Submit your project as a public GitHub repository containing all source code, assets, and necessary documentation.
2. **Comprehensive README:** Your repository must include a detailed **`README.md`** file covering the project overview, installation and usage instructions, technologies used, and team member contributions.
3. **Testnet Interactions (Must):** Provide documented proof of testnet interactions, including transaction hashes, smart contract addresses (or Port).
4. **Demo Video (Must):** Enhance your submission with a short demo video (5-10 minutes) showcasing your project's key features and functionality.

Submissions will be evaluated based on innovation, technical complexity, impact, design, completeness, and their ability to facilitate community engagement. Please refer to the detailed [Submission Format](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/blob/main/Participant%20Instructions/Submission%20Format.md) for comprehensive guidelines.

### Judging criteria 
The PIT consists of a predefined [scoring rubric](https://github.com/polymerdevs/PIT-Phase-1/blob/main/Participant%20Instructions/Judging%20Criteria.md#scoring-rubric) to provide transparency and fairness in evaluating contributions across a spectrum of activities, from dApp development to protocol implementation and beyond. This rubric not only sets clear expectations but also guides participants towards contributing high-quality work that advances the Polymer ecosystem.

To maintain engagement and a competitive spirit among teams and developers, we will implement a leaderboard that tracks the points scored. This will help Polymer facilitate rewards, promoting healthy competition and community engagement, encouraging participants to put their best foot forward.

## Developer Incentives
PIT offers developers opportunities for engagement and potentially influence the future direction of Polymer's interop solutions. Thus, performance on the leaderboard enables participants to ascend through the ranks, towards potential partnership, gaining exclusive access to Polymer resources and potential developer allocation in the future.

# Contribute to IBC Solidity standards
IBC is a well documented and battle-tested protocol with many developers contributing code/standards to improve its developer experience and help other applications build off of their work. The PIT empowers further contributions, there are a few IBC standards Polymer thinks can be used by a wide variety of applications. 

Similar implementations already exist in EVM and we leave it to your best judgement to establish a fair analysis between them, propose and build a new standard that will help further the cosmosethereum.

Dive into the technicals between various standards which are available in IBC and their counter parts in Ethereum:

- Perform a technical overview of the designs.
- Compare the best features from each of the standards.
- Prepare a functioning solidity implementation and with an intuitive CLI for easier use.

Note: Research paper/proposal also counts as documentation in the rubric.
